This is a basic website I made for my wife when she began her career as an elementary schoo teacher. This is the first published website I ever made (using github pages and the domain [melissahalmaghi.com](http://melissahalmaghi.com/)), through making it I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, git and bootstrap. I still periodically update it as necissary.
